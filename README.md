### PDF Grabber

I want my scanner to scan PDFs to my local computer but

I have this ~hammer~ *scanner* which scans documents to PDF files and
puts them on my server.

So running this script from the server or my local computer allows me
to get curl commands for each scanned PDF so I can grab the PDFs onto
my machine.

Use this code at your own ~perl~ *peril*.
